## Installation
There are several ways to install the datapack into your world/server.  
I always recommend using Git so it is easy to obtain updates later.

### Git Pull
All you need for this is having [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

**Install the datapack**
1. Make sure Git is installed by executing this command `git --version`.
2. Navigate to the `datapacks` directory inside your world/save directory.
3. Open terminal/cmd in that directory and run:  
`git pull https://github.com/gaycookie/Uncraft-Datapack.git`
4. All you do now is running `/reload confirm` inside Minecraft.

**Update the datapack**
1. Navigate to `Uncraft-Datapack` inside the `datapacks` directory.
2. Open terminal/cmd in that same directory and run `git pull`.
3. All you do now is running `/reload confirm` inside Minecraft.
